## About


A brief introduction to your project. Include what it does, why it's useful, and any other relevant information that would help users understand the purpose of your project.

An E-Learning platform we developed as part of our Intership Project. We built this for Geniotech, an Egypt-based local startup which provides coding and programming classes for kids aged 3-18+. They also required a video-calling and chat interface in order to conduct classes within the platform itself. 

## Features

- Video calling with chat and screen share features
- Integrated payment using Square.
- Optionally, include screenshots or gifs to demonstrate functionality

You can run the app using a django server.
